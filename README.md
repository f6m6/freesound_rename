# freesound_rename
script to rename files downloaded from freesound to their descriptive name

run it in the directory containing a bunch of files downloaded from freesound. if you've already run the script on some of them then it won't affect them. however any files containing "__" in their name will be mangled by it. so i recommend only using it on dirs that only contain files that have either been freshly downloaded from freesound or renamed by this script itself. thanks
